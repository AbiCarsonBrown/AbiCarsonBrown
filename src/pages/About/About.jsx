        Hi, I'm Abi, a Full-Stack Software Engineer. My background includes a
        degree in Mathematics and a rewarding 5-year tenure in Fashion
        Merchandising.
        <br />
        <br />
        With a passion for problem-solving and a knack for diving into tasks
        headfirst, Software Engineering sparked my interest.
        <br />
        <br />
        Having completed a bootcamp at BrainStation, Iâ€™m excited to apply what I
        have learned to real world projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        My mission is to bring joy and excitement to people's lives through
        innovative software solutions.
