        Hi, I'm Abi, a Software Engineer with a unique journey. My background
        includes studying Mathematics at university and a rewarding 5-year
        tenure in Fashion Merchandising, primarily at ASOS. Following my time at
        ASOS, I ventured into other merchandising roles, but I yearned for a
        more challenging path. With a passion for problem-solving and a knack
        for diving into tasks headfirst, a friend introduced me to the world of
        Software Engineering. This sparked my interest, leading me to enrol in a
        BrainStation bootcamp. Now, with these new skills, both Front-End and
        Back-End, under my belt, Iâ€™m excited to apply what I have learned to
        real world projects. My mission is to bring joy to people's lives
        through innovative software solutions.
